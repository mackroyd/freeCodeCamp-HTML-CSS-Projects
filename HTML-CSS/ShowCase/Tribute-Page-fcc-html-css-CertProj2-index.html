<p id="personal-note">
  Thank you, Dr. Blackburn, for your encouragement. Our brief meeting during your presentation at my former community college on May 12th, 2015 â€” when you kindly answered my question about the viability of using nanotechnological methods to structurally extend telomeres â€” was incredibly meaningful to me. Your words stayed with me and helped me believe in my own potential, even through my darkest hours.
